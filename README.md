Extreme Barbie Car Racing is a Unity project where a car rolls down an obstacle-ridden ramp, meant to demonstrate different situtations where physics principles can apply. This project was completed to complete the requirements of a grade 12 physics project. My role in the project was idea generation, dealing with the management of our version control system, making design choices, setting up a simple UI, and creating and reviewing our presentation.

The inspiration of this project was watching videos like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PmtYffCMv0, where Barbie Jeeps are raced using gravity.

This repo contains a pdf file explaining the project, which was used as our in-class presentation.
